## Features

### Nav bar

At the top of the page the logo is shown with the navidation bar to the right. This includes links to the
About us, Monthly tip, Newsletter sign up and contact us sections. 

I have use the google font Courgette from the sans family as i wanted to use someting that was clear to read but also had the sense of handwritting
to make the user feel like they are reading someones own cleaning manual that they are sharing with them.

## Testing

I have used devtools device bar and Am I responsive to see the responsiveness of my page. [Link to Am I responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://stacd.github.io/Cleaning-Campus/)

I tested the page by sending the link to family members to use on their own devices and opened it up on my own device on both chrome and Microsoft Edge.

I have tested the form which does submit successfully and will only work with all fields completed and an email in the email field.

My external links to social media pages and the planner link on amazon also work.

### Bugs

#### Solved Bugs

I had miss labeled for my aria-label when i first added them in as i had used aria-labelledby by mistake so i replaced with the aria-label and it corrected this.

I had used span instead of div in my About us section which flaged up in HTML validating, this has now been corrected.

### Validator Testing

HTML passed through the validator with no errors.

CSS passed through the validator with no errors.

For Accessibility I ran the lighthouse in devtoold to ensure my page was easy to read and met a high accessibilty standard.

### Unfixed Bugs

No bugs are present however I would if had more time worked on the placement of the images on the site to get a sharper finish to the look of the site.
